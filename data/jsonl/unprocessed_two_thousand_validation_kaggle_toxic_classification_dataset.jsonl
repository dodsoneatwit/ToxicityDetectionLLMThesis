I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information, and certaintly not enough for individual players. I think those articles are poorly done, and I'm not interested in improving them. I do not like the prose-style recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of \"\"In week X of the XXXX season, Player X did this and that against Team X in a XX-XX win/loss...\"\" For the longest time that's how Drew Brees' 2009 season (a great individual season that deserves better writing) read. It still has some of those problems. \r\n\r\nThe way I've done it gives it structure. You don't have to repeat who the opponent was, what week it was or the result. And these are NFL players. They'll play 16 games a year, 20 at the most with the playoffs. I'm not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games. It's a small sample. Write a sentence or two for each game and you're talking 16-40 sentences at the most. Hardly creates a long section.\r\n\r\nI really suggest you look at Denard Robinson (Michigan QB) and his current season recap. He has sub-sections with lots of text for each individual game this year. And you know what, I don't see anyone changing it or complaining about it. It doesn't bother me. While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players (so don't get worried), I have to say their info is written pretty well and it's sourced and everything. That much info on one game is pretty crazy, but you know what, where are the restrictions on space?\r\n\r\nCome on man, this is the internet. We're not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia. The space is there. I'll make sure to refrain from any further mention of team-oriented things like \"\"going on a bye week\"\", but other than that, the text has been about Ben, so it's on topic and referenced. I don't see the big deal, and I can't say I'm seeing other people questioning it besides yourself. I didn't even start Manning's 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having, but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today. Looks fine to me. And since there's been free reign given on these kind of sections, again, I don't see the problem.   \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  \r\n\r\nI haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  \r\n\r\nIMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an \"\"alternate ending\"\"). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  \r\n\r\n1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in \"\"Night at the Museum\"\". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. \r\n2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.\r\n\r\n3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.\r\n\r\n4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a \"\"popular\"\" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981 \r\n\r\nJiust to make clear on the last point, that I offered no such argument. Mel Etitis (Talk)  \r\n\r\nSorry bout that. It was early for me, and I hadn't had my coffee yet. \r\nIspy1981 \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:\r\nOn Milch\u2019s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only \uf733\uf736\uf730 fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged \uf732\uf735\uf730 single- and \uf736\uf734 twin-engined aircraft a month during \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf731.

Would you like to see a personal attack?  You, sir, are a passive aggressive who has tried to drum up support for your cause among disinterested editors based on a quantitative application of the rules of wikipedia.  There is also such a thing as qualitative, that is spirit of the law, rather than letter of the law that you seem to be incapable of understanding.  \r\nAs I stated, I reverted because I realized that I was in the 'Crucifixion in art' section and that my statement didn't wholly apply.  I reverted because there is important art scattered among Manga, and the movies and 30 minute toy commercials of Anime. If this had been the 'crucifixion' article I would have left my statement in.  Having said that, I will restate my objections to that particular image.  Sailor Moon, the Comic, is an important and potentially relevant piece of art.  It is the Wonder Woman of Japanese Manga;  it is liberating to girls in an otherwise oppressive culture.  Sailor Moon, the Cartoon, exists only to sell plastic make-up cases and moon wands to 8-12 year olds.  Art requires that the Artist had something to say.  If you found an identical image from the comic, and some source that said that Naoko Takeuchi had some reason for it being there, I would have little objection.   As I said, there are other actually relevant and artistic crucifixions done in Anime and Manga, and I would have no objection to those being included either.  68.114.130.234"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves \"\"Podiatrists\"\". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves \"\"Dr.\"\" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK \"\"podiatrists\"\", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix \"\"Dr.\"\" and the associated title \"\"podiatrist\"\". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist.

WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve \"\"theory\"\" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to \"\"the former Phlogiston theory\"\" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. \r\nFor 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. Cheers,    \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Also, there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who are quick to remove material they see as inappropriate and 185 editors have this article on their watchlist. This can work very well - see above for how quickly the offensive material was removed from this article - so I expect the default will be to carry on as normal unless problems arise. If they do, there's a whole range of measures that include blocking particular editors from Wikipedia or barring brand new or unregistered editors.   \r\n\r\n The Elephant in the Room \r\n\r\nQUESTION.

Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

If you look at that page it is a very long list of airlines, but if you try to edit it you will see it is actually just a bunch of sublists on separate pages put together. My proposal is to have the main page List of World War I flying aces, and then many subpages List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (A-F) List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (G-Q), List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (R-Z), etc. (I chose those names based on other list series, and so that they will be able to stand as lists on their own.)

Including this in the lead is wrong - not so much for the current wording, but that this is the thin end of the wedge that will see others want to build on that. There is a strong double-standars issue here.   \r\n\r\n Infoboxes \r\n\r\nHi, I see you have changed infoboxes for Beverley & Market Weighton to infobox settlement. But can you please explain how this change fits in with our WP:UKCITIES standard which states \"\"All settlements of the United Kingdom (that are not coterminous with a local government district) are to use the Template:Infobox UK place, though some very rare exceptions exist. For those that are coterminous with a local government district (which are usually large cities / unitary districts or equivalent\u2014such as Liverpool, Leicester, and Bristol), please use Template:Infobox settlement.\"\"\r\n\r\nAs for as I can determine we should be using the UK Infobox for these places not the settlement box.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe coat of arms added to the infobox for Beverley is not current and so should not be in the article as far as I can see.  \r\n\r\n Edit war and the three revert rule \r\n\r\nMay I make you aware that the three revert rule prohibits users restoring material more than 3 times in a rolling 24 hour period. You appear to be engaged in an edit war at Beverley and are not contributing to discussion but enforcing preferences upon articles that others object to.  | \u00a0Talk\u00a0  \r\n\r\nI had a right to remove this as you do not have a consensus. Four editors have commented they do not want that infobox, whilst you have continued to revert to it. I will be reporting you for breach of 3RR (despite a warning), which may see you loose your editting privlidges. I'm also displeased with your edit summmaries and comments on talk pages which appear to be disparaging.  | \u00a0Talk\u00a0  \r\n\r\nI've reported you for 3RR. However, at this stage I must also express my concern about your comments at Talk:Market Weighton and your edits to Manchester which are incivil and distruptive respectively. This does nothing but harm Wikipedia and harm your reputation.  | \u00a0Talk\u00a0  \r\n\r\nPS please re-read WP:UKCITIES (not WP:CITIES as you keep referring to). Manchester has the distinction of being a local government district, whereas Selby etc do not. UKCITIES states that local government district ONLY should use Template:Infobox settlement. However, don't take this up with me, please resume debate at Talk:Beverley to achieve a way forwards.  | \u00a0Talk\u00a0  \r\n\r\nI think at this stage you're likely to incur a much greater block on your account as well as bring more attention to your editting style. Remember, do not distrupt Wikipedia to make a point. Your edits to Manchester are not in good faith and starkly so (you are gaming false claims of consensus). Have you not considered what maturity and respectabiliy level appears? I do not believe you are being conductive to the good of the project and I suspect you would agree. Why not rethink your approach?  | \u00a0Talk\u00a0  \r\n\r\nI was going to ask you to quote the guidance from UKCITIES that you are referring too, but I think this is a rather pointless waste of time frankly.

For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says \"\"I'm going to Havana to shop\"\". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics.

Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a \"\" hog and pig\"\" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: \"\"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue\"\". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.\r\n\r\nYOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is \"\"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body\"\" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Will take proper research to do that bit justice  and if anyone does a \"\"shoutout\"\" to Sidney, but not Miles City, Glendive, Glasgow or maybe even Baker and Wibaux, (and, of course, Ekalaka!) we will be in all sorts of trouble! (grin)  Plus, at the moment, with that murder out in Sidney, the place is coming under a lot of scrutiny for the boomtown atmosphere, and so I suggest we tread delicately.  (talk) \r\n\r\n Article Structure \r\n\r\nOkay, so there seems to be no basic consensus on how this article should be structured.  I can't find an outline in the wikiprojects sections, so I am going to attempt to make one based on the the only three states at FA-Class Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Virginia and the nearest GA-Class article, South Dakota.  Yes, we're being beaten by South Dakota.  Here is my suggestion: \r\n\r\nEtymology \u2014 (see OK's) \u2014 Short description of where the name Montana comes from\r\nGeography \u2014 (see SD's) \u2014 General descriptions about size and location\r\nGeology and terrain \u2014 Junk about east v west, mountains, rivers, etc.  Just not a bunch of lists\r\nFlora and fauna \u2014 kind of obvious; may need to break state into regions  \r\nClimate\r\nProtected lands \u2014 State and national parks, I guess.\r\nHistory \u2014 Summarize and send off to the History of Montana page\r\nAmerican Indian reservations \u2014 Brief overview and description of the Indian reservations in Montana.  Could be linked here until a separate page can be made.\r\nCities and Towns \u2014 (See OK's) \u2014 Briefly describe the make-up of Montana's cities and towns.  Not a giant list. There's already one here, just send people there.  Really, only those with more than 50,000 should be listed on this page, but given that doesn't even include the capital we may as well go down to Kalispell at around 20,000 (i.e. the largest seven).  No other town even has 10,000.  We're not exactly waiting up on election night for the Havre votes to come in.\r\nDemographics \u2014 Basic census crap written in prose\r\nPopulation\r\nAncestry\r\nReligion\r\nEconomy\r\nCulture \u2014 (see OK's and (VA's))\r\nArts and theatre \u2014 We have plenty of museums and theatres across the state.  You could list the most important ones first, but eventually they need to be put into prose.\r\nFestivals and events \u2014 Ditto\r\nSports and recreation\r\nOrganized sports \u2014 Probably mostly college sports and minor league baseball.  Could add state games and skiing competitions I guess.\r\nOutdoor recreation \u2014 hiking, fishing, mountain biking, skiing, etc.\r\nGovernment and politics \u2014 (see OK's)\r\nState government\r\nLocal government\r\nTribal government\r\nNational Politics\r\nEducation \u2014 School districts, administration, universities/colleges, etc.\r\nMedia \u2014 (see OK's and SD's) \u2014 Links to lists should be okay, but here only the largest and prominent should be mentioned as well as Nielsen zones, etc.\r\nHealth \u2014 (see VA's and OK's) \u2014 MT's healthcare system, stats, and perhaps main hospitals.\r\nTransportation \u2014 (see OK's) \u2014 Basic info from the MDOT on our roads, train stations, and airports.  And, the basic health of our transportation system.\r\nState symbols \u2014 (see VA's)\r\nSee also\r\n\r\nAny Comments?\r\n  \r\n\r\nThanks for the list, Dsetay  (you forgot to sign it above) No question the article is not of good quality and needs to be improved.  I don't have a lot of time to devote to this, but I'd support and offer minor assistance to an improvement drive. The Oklahoma or Minnesota articles would probably be the best guides, as both have notable Native American populations and are more or less in the west.  SD would be fine to fill in gaps, but GA being a less fussy standard than FA, I'd split any debates in favor of an FA structure.  [[User talk:Montanabw|"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The section was restored with an addition to the section discussing Aryan Anarchism on the talk page inviting you to explain your somewhat bizarre comment. Bearing in mind Lala Hardayal's prominent position as an academic philosopher and Stanford University, involvement with the IWW and eventual departure from the USA following his arrest for his anarchist activities, your suggestion that the piece is not notably anarchist is hard to understand. This is compounded by your final quip \"\"'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right\"\". Perhaps you could explain why you regard the self-organisation of migrants against repressive immigration control? For that is certainly a feature of tehir involvement with the voyage of the Komagata Maru. Is it odd that this movement, as with every other anarchist movement, throws up contradictions. I think not! Did not Peter Kropotkin throw in his lot with Tzar and encourage Russians fight Germans as a war against the state. Was not Pierre-Joseph Proudhon a patriotic anti-communist noted for his sexist attitude to women. His anti-semitism is matched by that of the pan slavic nationalist, Bakunin.

Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means \u201cbeyond the forests\u201d, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today\u2019s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! \r\n\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The races should be mentioned in the bios, because race is biographical information.

I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede. I should also note that many of our sources are for-profit media outlets who have no qualms about distorting stories to make them fit their most profitable narrative agenda, which, in this era, is black/white racial conflict (the coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting is an excellent example).

Richie Ramone did not say he would \"\"sue and reap millions\"\" There are no interviews with Richie Ramone about his lawsuit. Only statements from his lawyers.Sources please?\r\n\r\nc)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone was \"\"embittered\"\" that he left. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. Source please?\r\n\r\nd) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was never financially successful, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. They were dropped by Sire Records that same year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. \r\n\r\ne)Richie Ramone did not sue his \"\"dead band mates\"\". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. \r\n\r\nFirst Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in \"\"hardship\"\" is not sourced. \r\n\r\nRequest: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources.

Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop.

Support Mom And Avoid Father\u2019s Rights Groups\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, fatherhood has been all the rage and dads are naturally the talk of pundits on Father\u2019s Day.

According to the pro-feminist men\u2019s group The National Organization For Men Against Sexism (NOMAS), \u201cmale supremacist groups (\u201cFather\u2019s Rights\u201d) have caused unspeakable harm to our country and to our children by encouraging abusive fathers, often with little past involvement with their children, to seek custody as a tactic to pressure a mother to return or to punish her for leaving. \u201cShared parenting\u201d, \u201cfriendly parent\u201d, involvement of both parents and other concepts that seem fair and benevolent have instead been used to manipulate courts and legislatures to help abusive fathers.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are feminist groups that, frankly, view men as biologically and culturally flawed to begin with and father's as unnecessary opining as to the beliefs and goals of people interested in father's rights and, here on Wikipedia, they are characterized as, not just authoritative sources for information on father's rights groups, but also members of those groups who act as their spokesman.  It should go without saying but quotes like the above and sources that make them would be universally reviled by anyone interested in father's rights advocacy.

W. Elven, Correspondent Of The M\u00fcnchen Latest\r\nNews  Cincinnati, Mid June\r\nWilliam J. Flynn has published a part of his War Memoirs in the weekly Liberty, which is much read here.\r\nDuring the war, Flynn was the Head Of The United States Secret Service. The Service encompasses the whole\r\ncountry, and is brilliantly organised. In peacetime it primarily provides for the personal security of the President.\r\nIts attention is enjoyed by whatever else in the national capital is in need of protection, or thinks it needs so. It\r\nkeeps under surveillance all doubtful elements somehow suspected of connections with political tendencies\r\nhostile to the government and its spokesmen. During the war its principal task was to keep an eye on those who\r\nmore or less loudly had made themselves noticeable in opposition to the war, or who merely were suspected of\r\nnot being in agreement with the Wilsonian war policy. Germans also enjoyed its special care, and at that time\r\nmany fell into the traps which had been laid everywhere by the Federal Secret Service.\r\nFrom Flynn's memoirs, however, we learn that the Secret Service had been assigned an important mission even\r\nbefore our entry into the war. In the year 1915, a full two years before the declaration of war, the most efficient\r\ntelephone expert was summoned to Washington and assigned the task of arranging the leading telephone wires\r\nto the German and Austrian embassies in such a way that Secret Service officials could tap every conversation\r\nfrom any source that was held between the ambassadors and their personnel, as well as every conversation\r\nemanating from the embassy offices. A room was set up with which all the wires were linked in such an\r\ningenious way that not even a single conversation could be missed. Service men sat in this room day and night,\r\ndictating the overheard conversations to the stenographers seated beside them. Every night the head of the Secret\r\nService Bureau, that is, the author of the article in Liberty, received a stenographic report of all the conversations\r\nheld in the preceding twenty four hours, so that on the very same evening he was able to communicate\r\neverything important to the State Department and to President Wilson.\r\nLet us bear in mind the time this installation was created, at the beginning of the year 1915, that is, at the time\r\nwhen the United States still lived in peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and Wilson never tired of giving\r\nassurances that he harboured no hostile intentions against Germany. It was also the time when the German\r\nAmbassador in Washington, Count Bernstorff, neglected no opportunity to show due appreciation of Wilson's\r\nfriendly disposition and feelings for Germany and the German Folk. It was also the time when Wilson gave his\r\nconfidant Baruch instructions to begin the gradual mobilisation of industry for war; also the time in which it\r\nbecame increasingly obvious, as the American historian Harry Elmer Barnes also sets forth in his book On The\r\nOrigins Of The Great War, that Wilson was firmly decided to enter the war, and postponed the execution of his\r\nbellicose plans only because public opinion first had to be won over for these plans.\r\nFlynn's memoirs must finally remove the ground from the foolish chatter that Wilson was pushed into the war\r\nagainst his will by German submarine warfare. The tapping of the telephone wires leading to the German\r\nembassy took place with his knowledge. We also learn this from Flynn's memoirs. The author adds that the\r\nmaterial thus gathered against Germany contributed considerably to the eventual break. This can prove only that\r\nthis put means in Wilson's hands to win public opinion for the war long planned by him. And in fact this\r\nmaterial was wholly and ideally suited for it. The Memoirs confirm to the fullest extent what unfortunately must\r\nstill be said, that Germany at that time was represented in Washington in a downright incredibly incompetent\r\nand incredibly unworthy way. If we hear that in one passage Flynn writes that the stenographic reports prepared\r\nfor him daily contained enough material to keep a divorce lawyer busy for months on end, then we get a general\r\nidea of what went on.\r\nThe Secret Service maintained women agents in Washington and New York whose job it was to sound out the\r\nmembers of the German Embassy, Bernstorff included, whenever anything important happened. One of these\r\nwoman agents kept a better class apartment in Washington in which the gentlemen met their ladies, and where\r\noccasionally even Secretary Of State Lansing dropped in to hear what was new.

Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:\r\n\r\nBecause of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. \r\n\r\nThis is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding \"\"sea level\"\" or \"\"liftoff\"\" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:\r\n\r\n Sea level liftoff thrust\r\n Sea level peak thrust\r\n Sea level average thrust\r\n Vacuum liftoff thrust\r\n Vacuum peak thrust\r\n Vacuum average thrust\r\n\r\nThe problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).\r\n\r\nWhen comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.\r\n\r\nIn theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

There are just 3 or 4 bad apples. After that is dealt with, you will find an entirely new atmosphere conducive to collegial editing and encyclopedia building. Please try to keep in mind and remember what I said even if some situation looks \u201cvolatile\u201d to you. I can do it on my own.-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.\r\n\r\nOnce the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.\r\n\r\nIf you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.\r\n\r\nAll of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask \"\"if they can be white, then why should I not be?\"\"  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  \r\n\r\nSadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.\r\n\r\nI still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning \"\"your type of whites as opposed to my type\"\" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I didn't realise that this was your article.  I will not edit it again.  \r\n\r\nI saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?\r\n\r\nI have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say \"\"This article written by .....\"\" and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nI saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.\r\n\r\nAs I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you \"\"scaring them off\"\", as you put it.  \r\n\r\nI don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.\r\n\r\nIt's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.\r\n\r\nSo goodbye.

Your repeated shrill invocations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are frankly risible, makes you look foolish and shows a clear misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is and what it is not. Simply, talk pages of Wikipedia articles are not vehicles for individuals to impart their own unsupported viewpoints. You must understand this. You do not have the \"\"freedom\"\" to hijack them for another purpose, to express your own view. Talk pages are there to discuss (supportable) improvements to the article, not for debate on the topic. If you intended to do so at Scots language your proposed improvement was not clear. For instance are we to extrapolate that your contention is that the topic doesn't exist, so neither should the article (in which case nominate for deletion)? Was it something else? All that is clear is your own POV, unsupported by any reliable evidence. The appropriate place for this type of postulation is not here on an article talk page - maybe start your own blog or discuss on chat rooms.\r\n\r\nYou clearly have either not read or not understood WP:NOTFORUM, which you have been directed to by several editors. Speaking of which, your portrayal of being thwarted by one individual is not accurate, though I'm not sure if this is due to you not having the skills to know this because of your newness as an editor. Numerous people have removed your soapboxing.\r\n\r\nNow you are taking the inappropriateness of your posts to a bizarre new level by discussing your perceived martyrdom regarding your inadmissable soapboxing on Scots at Talk:Comparison of Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and Standard Danish. How on earth does this have any pertinence to improvement of the article on the comparison of Bokm\u00e5l and Danish? That is why I am going to remove that section from that talk page.\r\n\r\nPlease also familiarise yourself with what a minor edit is. Adding or removing content, be it from a an article or a talk page is not a minor edit. Again you probably don't know that because you are new.\r\n\r\nI hope you do take time to learn about how Wikipedia works and on that basis, and since you haven't been given a WP:WELCOME, I will post one below as it gives some other useful indications about how to edit here.   \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

So, no, the Akins coat of arms is not marshalled per pale, it is simply two charges placed side by side, and the crest consists of two ravens (\"\"twa corbies\"\") as is indicated by other examples of the Akins coat of arms found on earlier tombstones: Alexander Akins gravestone Archibald Akins gravestone.\r\n\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the \"\"White\"\" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. \r\n\r\nNot on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   \r\n\r\nDefine \"\"convict.\"\" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy.

They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the \"\"Bobover Rebbe\"\", who can use the name Bobov.\r\n\r\nBerkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.\r\n\r\nThink for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.\r\n\r\nThere was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a \"\"mamshich\"\" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a \"\"mamshich\"\" of Sanzer Ruv.\r\n\r\nTry to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.\r\n\r\nPutting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.\r\n\r\nIf you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.\r\n\r\nI went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.\r\n\r\nIn any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. \r\n\r\nIt would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a \"\"final process\"\" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's \"\"use it to tip people on social media\"\" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.   \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,. But, due to the rise of dilettantism fused with a plethora of societal changes, influence of external cultures and severe lack of awareness about real Vedic injunctions, the role of religion has withered over the years.\r\n\r\nBut alas, thanks to all the slanderous and conjectural accusations heaped upon the Vedas that can be attributed mainly to the interpretations of commentaries written by Mahidhar, Uvat and Saayan in the medieval times; and to what Vam-margis or the Tantra cult propagated in their books in the name of the Vedas, animal Sacrifice is rashly associated with Hinduism (as if the religion itself promotes violence against animals).\r\n\r\nIn the more recent times, Swami Dayanand Saraswati \u2013 known as the grandfather of modern India \u2013 interpreted the Vedas as per the correct grammars of the language and authentic evidences.

Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living.  Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly?

MONGO made abrupt, final decisions without any discussion, nor without any other editor's input.  He deleted everything I added within minutes, did not leave room for discussion, ignored my Talk page discussion, removed all of my POV templates, did not wait for other editors to take part.  In particular, he removed my 1 sentence 1 source (Outside Magazine) addition to the article, and cited only personal reasons, rather than objective reasons, which is why I did the POV templates.  The reason for blocking me was that I stated he committed \"\"Vandalism\"\".  I stated \"\"potential Vandalism\"\".  I'm new to wikipedia and it seemed he was unilaterally vandalizing a perfectly good 1 sentence and 1 national magazine article.  Seems MONGO was edit warring.  Could you review my simple addition to the article, and review whether he was committing vandalism, etc?  Seems no one is assessing his conduct, and is placing all blame on me.

I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of \"\"Europe\"\" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil \"\"Snakefinger\"\" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying \"\"we aren't going there,\"\" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that \"\"the mysterious N. Senada\"\" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town \"\"Ensenada\"\" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos \"\"matter\"\" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, \"\"those who know, they don't let it show.\"\"  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own \"\"real\"\" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the \u2018right to life\u2019 under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother\u2019s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the \u2018right to life\u2019 to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life.

This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem.\r\nThe mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.\r\nAs to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  \r\nQuite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the \"\"Tether in Space Handbook\"\", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.\r\nYou could also just read the abstracts for the non-open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept.  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports; NASA, reference 19, Lockheed Martin, references 5, 8, 9, and 10, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, reference 7.  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie?\r\n\r\nTo conclude with the Boeing report.  The Boeing report says \r\n1) \"\"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.\"\"\r\n\r\n5.0 km/s is 64% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built.  I have no argument with this.\r\n\r\n2) \"\"Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4.0 km/s (13 kft/s or Mach 13) would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass.\"\"\r\n\r\n4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.\r\n\r\nThe tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.\r\nAs a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, \"\"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. \"\" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.\r\n\r\nDo you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non-rotating skyhooks in this article?\r\n\r\nPS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it.  Since you keep deleting references with your changes, the reference numbers keep changing, hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything.\r\n\r\nSo please, read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying.\r\nIf you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily, write me here and I will do what I can to assist you.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

You did not specify user names, but you did specify users by their arguments: \"\"unhelpful meta discussion about the use of T: prefixes in general\"\", but when an editor writes , incorrectly, you do not use that argument. This way my arguments were rejected explicitly in one stroke, while wrong arguments are still weighing in. The same can be said for the overstated \"\"consensus\"\": not thrown out (more on this later). You also have used the comment that it is , which is a malversion of my arguments (you did not find). From all this I feel & read that only my arguments were targeted off-topic.\r\n\r\n... not whether T: redirects in general should be deleted. This is bs. I reasoned like: \"\"a T: redirect is bad in mainspace, so these twelve should all be deleted\"\". Plain sound reasoning. I did use argumental examples in some places, but I did not, nowhere, argue that other, non-listed Rs are to be deleted. It was someone else who expanded it into too wide  not me. Keep'er \"\"Technical 13\"\", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an \"\"WP:NS#Aliases\"\". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If \"\"Keep\"\" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way?\r\nAlso, in one point you complain that there was \"\"no discussion about the individual redirects\"\". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning.\r\nAs was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 \"\"non-controversial\"\" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed?\r\nIt doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing \"\"history\"\" as a reason. \r\n\r\nYes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this? You concluded that there was no individual targeting (and check that the nom is addressing them by listing them, and that the nom is detailing arguments very specific). The I point to them, and you jump to arguments. Did you or did you not see them when closing?\r\n\r\n In particular your proving that transclusion didn't work was argued to be not relevant to way the redirect was used (remember these are redirects to templates not templates), and and your opinion alone does not demonstrate consensus. A catch 22 you created. First you complain that no individual Rs were mentioned, then I point to one that was already there, and then you say: but that is not consensus. Yeah, and what did you expect, of an argument??? You only accept arguments that so"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the \"\"tradecraft\"\" used to collect this information.\r\nHey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says \"\"Hey Balls get ready for a patry\"\" Balls replies \"\"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nIncidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/\r\n\r\nThe Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.\r\n\r\nDifferent intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU\r\n ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. \r\n\r\nVarious Forms\r\nUnlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.\r\n\r\nThe US defines espionage towards itself as \"\"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web\r\n  | last = US Department of Defense\r\n  | authorlink = U.S. Department of Defense\r\n  | title = Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defe"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine. Given Plummer's age, I don't think a mention in Laurence's article about Plummer's belief is that pertient, although I am pretty sure it'll make its way into the Bede series of articles. On the canon law bit, I think the bit I've mentioned is enough to establish that it was irregular, but that opinions are divided. (Gotta love those Victorian scholars who just KNEW what was right (grins)). I guess my main problem with Plummer is that he's over a hundred years old. More modern scholars seem to think that reliance on canon law wasn't as important to the papacy and the chuech at this point in time. For Laurence the important points are that he was consecrated by his predecessor and that some folks may have felt this was irregular. Plummer seems to be more concerned with what Bede was doing and saying that what actually happened in Laurences time, I'd rather throw this information into the Historia article.  - Talk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I am sending you this message since you are a member of the GA WikiProject. I would like to invite you to consider helping with the GA sweeps process. Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.\r\n\r\nWe are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or  and we'll be happy to help. Happy editing!

This used to happen a while back; either pages for both British English and American English would exist, or more often editors would fight to move a page from one to the other. In June 2005, the Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee ruled that \"\"when either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change. For example, with respect to British spelling as opposed to American spelling, it would only be acceptable to change from American spelling to British spelling if the article concerned a British topic.\"\" So since an enterprising Brit got there first, American English words like millimeter and liter redirect to the British English equivalent, but the opposite is true for colour or carburettor.\r\n\r\nIn the case of geologic map, an American was the first to create the article, so you have to edit that page. However, here's a few suggestions of what you can do:\r\nThe text in bold in the opening line should reflect the title of the article. Therefore, since geological map redirects to the page, you can change the first sentence to read \"\"A geologic map or geological map is a special-purpose map made to show subsurface geological features.\"\"\r\nIf there's a difference between U.S. and U.K. maps, I'd split the two into separate sections after the opening paragraph, and detail the differences for each (re-ordering the page as I'd done with this edit). If there's no difference, I'd just remove the specific references to the United States as being unnecessary, and expand on what's there.\r\nYou can also provide links to British geological maps if such a resource exists, as has already been done for USGS maps.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of the style ruling can be found at Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Disputes over style issues and Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English, or if you're really bored you can read the original case at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Jguk, which concerned and edit war over the use of BC or BCE for Biblical dates.

My point if simple, on wikipedia we are not usually encourage to put our own point of views. For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly. And we are here to be neutral even we dont belief on such things, did not give us right to present information which is offensive to any one, no matter which faith he or she belongs... regards.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The problem is that almost all of the sources you added to the article for Devil Shit are inappropriate for Wikipedia in general in various ways. Merchant sources such as iTunes are wildly inappropriate to use as sources in any way, shape, or form. Their primary purpose is to sell you something and regardless of the information they impart, they should never be used as a reliable, trivial, or even primary source. Secondly, the YouTube links are almost entirely unusable as many are not uploaded by the people that created the music or represent the artist. This is seen as a copyright violation and it's also something that shouldn't be linked to. In almost every case the only time you should link to a video is if it gives notability... which none of these do. Thirdly, the rest of the links are primary, which will never, ever, ever give notability. Never. You could have a primary source that establishes that someone won a Grammy for a devil shit song, but it still can't give notability. You should only list primary sources after you have a reliable source posted by a non-involved second party. The other problem is that with a lot of these sources the claims of devil shit aren't backed up in the actual source. For instance, this Twitter account doesn't say anything about the artist creating anything in this music genre. Saying that the artist performs devil shit based solely on the Twitter account is considered to be original research. You need reliable second party things that back up the information, but even then you have to understand that verification that the genre is performed by notable or non-notable persons is not enough to show notability for the genre to have an article. A genre can exist, but existing is not notability. Even if you re-add all of the sources and the performers without Wikipedia articles, that won't show that the genre is notable. If anything, it actually does a little more to injure the case here than to show notability. If you have 80+ sources, all of which are unusable for notability purposes and most of which are linked to performers that don't have articles (which many automatically presume means \"\"non-notable\"\" even if this isn't the case), then this tends to make many automatically assume that the topic in question is less notable, which means that they might not search as hard as they otherwise would. It's not right that this happens, but it happens. Sometimes in AfDs less is more.    (\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61)  \r\n\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick.\r\n:If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks.

If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.\r\nIf (4): Tell me the policy.

The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.\r\n\r\nThis book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text \u2014 the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to \"\"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations\"\" (p. 212).\r\n\r\nPaths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another \u2014 from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state \"\"cookie-cutter\"\" approach \u2014 looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German \u2014 both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.\r\n\r\n  \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

We all know it is self-reinforcing: the bias alienates Muslims, Indonesians, Arabs, and other groups who are demographically non-English-speaking and have significant headwinds in gaining consensus on ideological subjects related to their ethnicity. Those who stick around get pissed, and get blocked, further reinforcing the bias.

Now that User:Zlykinskyja has been hounded away from editing \"\"Murder of Meredith Kercher\"\", the wholesale axing of fully-sourced text has begun. See: removal of forensics. The apparent WP:Wikihounding of Zlykinskyja might have been as a woman, with legal expertise, trying to keep the article neutral in legal terms. I warned beware of \"\"colleagues gasping if they knew about editing on that lowly pedia\"\". Perhaps if American student Amanda had been \"\"Adam Knox\"\" then fewer people would want to remove sourced text disputing the evidence and 20? misquoted infamous statements. (I didn't know any evidence in December 2009, now I know much, and some seems falsified in Italy). Zlykinskyja tried to add how \"\"Donald Trump\"\" rejected the verdict (+source), but that was quickly deleted. Some US officials are conducting a mock-trial by judge to compare verdicts, but I doubt that could be explained in the article. Then some prankster this week posted at top, \"\"Breaking news: Knox dead in prison from suicide, details not confirmed\"\" (from an IP edit in the London area), and some say Knox cried in jail when she heard WP posted that. I wish we could split the article into several low-target subarticles (I noted Manson Family has 17 spinoff articles). The talk-page has resisted any attempt to reduce the rabid focus on \"\"Amanda Knox\"\" and naturally, a prior subarticle was AfD deleted.However, I suggest the following:\r\n \"\"Amanda Knox\"\" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article with civil suits, appellate trial, and college coursework in prison.\r\n \"\"Raffaele Sollecito\"\" (redirect) - becomes broad neutral article, noting he completed his computer degree while in custody, and they met, at a classical music concert, because he looked like Harry Potter.\r\n \"\"Prosecution of Amanda Knox\"\" (new) - would contain all the pro/anti-Knox text, moved from edit-wars in the Kercher article.\r\n \"\"Investigations of Kercher murder\"\" (new) - would be a forensic article, with fingerprints, Low copy number DNA, luminol, unidentified DNA/prints, listing exact quotes+sources, etc.\r\n \"\"Murder of Meredith Kercher\"\" (reduced) - would be trimmed into an overview, linking sections to subarticles.\r\nI have seen how other articles, split into subarticles, greatly reduce the vandalism in the spinoff details, so that forensic details would likely match the sources, when viewed there. This message is just a general notice, sent to a few admins, and I don't expect an immediate response. Also, feel free to delete this, knowing it was posted in a 1 May talk-page revision: as a May Day warning about axing of Kercher text. Thanks. -  \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be. The sort of people who apply for exercise testing are not likely to be already on the verge of a relapse or struggling to cope at work (or even at home). If some of them have practical help or accomodating family they would do worse in the same tests without it. Gosh, no mention of exertional insomnia even.\r\n\r\nMost of these studies aren't looking into a variety of somatic symptoms or even pain, only fatigue and functional strength (though the latter's good enough a demonstration of worsening after exercise for me. At the end of the day it's objective measures are most helpful).  If good evidence is totally lacking you have to use next best evidence, with caveats. \r\n\r\nYou miss out a major notable source of good evidence in all the ME studies (and synonymous diagnoses) before c. 1988 or the 80's, for instance papers by Acheson, Gilliam, Galpine, Innes, Compston, Wallis et al.  This is after all, where exercise intolerance and severe multi-system symptoms were first described and recognised as a cardinal feature in non-remitting cases.  \r\n\r\nThere should also be some orthostasis studies.

I will give you extreme examples to you now; \"\"Ottoman was a European country when it was at its most expanded territorial state\"\" is that right or wrong?

It's probably nothing more than a series of moot points, seeing as how her campaign has gained approximately zero traction.  If she's even shown her face here in Fairbanks, I'm sure I would have heard about it, and yet I haven't.\r\n\r\n Just saw your post a minute ago. I haven't had any time to look at Wikipedia in a while. You're quite correct. I defer to your more extensive fund of information on AK politics. I'm not sure why Sharon wasted her filing fee. There has been zero campaign, reflected in the lack of traction. Phone messages left for her after her announcement and e-mail both went unanswered. I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, \"\"None of the above\"\" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea. I thought you were a Washington State radio person or a punk rock band -). Given her name recognition, I expect she might win the primary if the party doesn't put out a mailer for Matt.   \r\n\r\nNow, on to Gabrielle LeDoux.  Once again, big gaping holes which require addressing.  First, Kurt LeDoux ran for Kodiak's Senate seat in 1982 as a Democrat, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Bob Mulcahy.  Gabrielle LeDoux was herself a Democrat for many years, including originally filing as such in 2004 before switching to the Republicans at the last minute.  \r\n\r\n I didn't realize she had switched. I haven't paid much attention to Kodiak since Zharoff left office. I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  \r\n\r\nSecond, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  \r\n\r\n Thanks for all your input. Please feel free to change or add.  I doh't have any ownership in Sharon's page.   \r\n\r\n \"\"Carpetbagger\"\" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

She may well have a 5-octave range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )\r\n98.30.29.58"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:\r\nListing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a \"\"sandbox\"\" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft\u200e if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. \r\nRe. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. \r\nYou say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.\r\nIf Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. \u2014 Cheers,  (Talk) \r\n\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Also, information given to me by the people whose computer I worked on in the past, who had upgraded to the 7.0 version, they stated the same flaws that I faced.  You were only giving half the information, and I the other half that you are trying to hide from the public to defraud them (this is based on your deleting this vital information that contributed to, and completed the article within the intent and purpose of the article). You were giving only the so called good qualities of the newer versions, but not the serious time consuming flaws (see below that which was listed in your article that you failed to mention, and do not want known).  \r\n\r\nIf one is working on the internet, on the old Mozilla versions there is tabs on the toolbar of the internet sites you are working on. If you should quit the internet a window appears asking if you want to cancel this action, quit, or quit and save tabs. By saving tabs, any time in the future when you pull up the internet there is the tabs, and you can take up where you left off. On the newer version of 7.0, this action is not available. You lose your work, and have to start all over again from the beginning. This is a severe cost of time. On the old versions, by the search window (http://) is three arrows, one pointing to the left, one to the right, and one pointing down. This last one allows one to see recent sites visited, and one can choose one by looking at the list that is presented. This is time saving. However, on 7.0 version this button is deleted, thus costing one time. Also, 7.0 version is not compatible with Youtube download toolbar, and will disable it. Also, when you upgrade,you will lose any history you have. The important information contained in the history list will be lost forever. \r\n\r\nThese flaws not only should be listed giving a complete informing article that informs and stays within the intent and purpose of the article, but, as all ready stated completes the article. \r\nIt would be like stating that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and that's all. My addition would be like giving the underlying causes that led to this act. This portion you would strive with your upmost efforts to hide and keep from the public.\r\nWhen a person only tells half the story then it is a lie, and if one does this with the intent deceiving the general public into taking a seriously flawed piece of trash, then it becomes fraud. With marketable product such fraud is a criminal act.

Can someone pleeease tell me why this individual is given the benefit of doubt over me? Also, who does he work for? If you click on Mr.choppers' history (do it now) you'll see a list longer than a toilet paper roll of his behavior (ie, undo undo undo, revert revert revert, citation needed citation needed citation needed). No adult would have the time for that. Not for free. So the issue is: Who is paying him to be such a terrible nuisance? Is he an organization? Is a major corporation paying him to disrupt valid information? I'd like the Wiki community to focus the spotlight on him/them (who/whatever choppers is) for a change.\r\n4. d15b8: it's a Honda engine. I own more than one original specimen. Yes I'm an authority on this motor. (If you can find another person who knows more, then I happily welcome his/her input!). So I'd like to ask (beg) the rest of the world to LEAVE MY EDITS ALONE. Mr.choppers and everyone else who has taken it upon themselves to get involved in this know NOTHING about this engine type. My edits are touched? I find that disturbing. Counterproductive. Ant-Wiki spirit. Reverse educational. Why would anyone bother to mess with my edits? Such dogma! (Me? I personally never stick my bamboo into other people's rice unless I have a better knowledge of chopsticks. Or rice.)\r\n5. This is a sad chapter for Honda enthusiasts such as myself. The current atmosphere of the Honda d15 engine page is plagued by unnecessarily fastidious and/or wrong people. I cling to the notion that one day the time-wasters & vandals will dissolve, and I can resume adding information that the rest of the world either does not know about the d15b8, or is unwilling/able to provide.\r\n6. No I don't want to sit here and answer to more \"\"talk page\"\" entries, from people who seem to have the time to waste. Not interested in responses. Don't dangle yet more volumes of rules in my face. I just want to improve the Honda engine page. Please just let me do my thing.\r\nOnce and for all, THE END.

To make sure my research isn't tainted by cherrypicking, I typed a neutral term into google: \"\"Definition Beat Generation\"\".

A page like this which strives for accuracy should acknowledge that there is no set definition (no \"\"majority\"\", no consus) on how the term should be used:\r\n\r\n\"\"Several key questions are central to the study of the Beat Generation. The first is whether a Beat Generation actually exists. If the Beat Generation consists of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, and a few others, then the Beat Generation does not exist because a generation cannot be based on just a few people. On the other hand, if the Beat Generation includes dozens and dozens of artists, including not only writers but also dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, then the Beat Generation does not exist because the concept is too loose, too vague.\"\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Lawlor. Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact. ABC-CLIO, 2005 \r\nISBN 1851094008, 9781851094004. pg. 78.\r\n\r\nFor this one, there may be some confusion by what Kerouac means by \u201cpeople who had been beaten down\u201d since that could apply to either the small group or the broader subculture. However, Morgan provides the same definition I presented earlier in which Kerouac identifies it as \u201ccertain members of the generation that came of age after World War II who affected detachment,\u201d etc. It\u2019s conceivable that one might argue Kerouac meant his group of friends by \u201ccertain people, but from many other sources, he meant the broader subculture (open for debate, but let\u2019s have that debate instead of blindly dismissing without evidence to support counterclaims). Here\u2019s the quote from Morgan:\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce the press began to identify those writers collectively as \u2018the Beat Generation,\u2019 some within the group began to struggle with a definition for the word beat. Since it was Jack Kerouac who had originally coined the phrase, he was asked repeatedly what he meant by it. Initially he said that the Beat Generation was composed of people who had been beaten down, worn out, and exhausted. As time passed, he refined his definition to emphasize the beatific, blessed, or sympathetic qualities of his generation.\u201d\r\n\r\nBill Morgan, William Morgan.

It looks like this:\r\n\r\nThe text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.\r\n\r\nWhen you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  \r\n\r\nI do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  \r\nSee it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  \r\nThat's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  \r\nI think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  \r\nIf you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  \r\n\r\n Your \"\"nonsense\"\" page \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of \"\"defacing\"\" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits \"\"are not worth reading\"\" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  \r\nI'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use \"\"nonsense\"\" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of \"\"cool,\"\" or \"\"awesome,\"\" or \"\"that's interesting,\"\" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as \"\"nifty.\"\" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear.

If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information.

I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as \"\"Article that has no meaningful, substantive content\"\". Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was \"\"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference\"\" followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I \"\"don't see any value\"\" in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have \"\"placeholder\"\" articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect \"\"we haven't written this page yet, but we will\"\" does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a \"\"userspace\"\" page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called User:JamesBWatson/Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.\r\nI give up quite a significant amount of my time to Wikipedia administration. Unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism, trivia, propaganda, uninformed adolescent speculation, illegal content, and other unhelpful stuff. If there weren't people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess, Wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. You are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wikipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to help implement those policies, but I disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as \"\"trolling\"\".\r\nI hope these comments will be helpful to you. If you have any further questions about these matters, please feel welcome to contact me here again. However, I have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about Wikipedia work, especially not calls from one continent to another.   \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

But Ross's works were so sought after, that famous cowboy after cowboy would only reccommend Ross.\r\n\r\nTo this day, not only are his works highly collectible and valuable because of WHO he was and WHAT he did, but Larry Mahan who is on the board of trustees for the P.R.C.A. still retains all of his Ross items and still speaks of his works and contibutions to the R.C.A. to this day.

Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw\r\n\r\n From Interpreted Language/Talk \r\n \r\nsome languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate ? Taw\r\n\r\nEvery time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15\r\n\r\nYou mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw\r\n\r\n I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley\r\n\r\n Old Interpreted Language article \r\n\r\nAn interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.\r\n\r\nIt is often a mistake to refer to a language as either \"\"interpreted\"\" or \"\"compiled\"\", because\r\nmost languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages\r\n(like Perl) are compiled at\r\nruntime but behave as if they were interpreted.\r\nOther languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an\r\nintermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).\r\nSome languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.\r\n\r\nAn example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIs Java interpreted, or what? \r\n\r\nThe Java programming language article says:\r\n\r\n\"\"The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC\r\n\r\nYes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an \"\"eval\"\" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt\r\n\r\nWay too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of \"\"compiling\"\".\r\nIt is used in two distinct meanings, as in:\r\n compiled to machine code (or assembly)\r\n compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation\r\n\r\nI think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way \"\"compiled\"\". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all \"\"compile\"\" source to some form of internal representation.\r\n\r\nQuote from FOLDOC:\r\n     Compiler\r\n\r\n     A program that converts another program\r\n     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to\r\n     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output\r\n     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine\r\n     language} by a separate {assembler}.\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

In sharp contrast, the global satellite temperature was stated by the majority of scientists to be the most credible scientifically. Moreover it is corroborated by the Meteorological balloon data. And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.\r\n\r\nI would therefore propose that the present graph utilising the less scientifically valid surface data which is in no sense global nor accurate given the massive and judgemental adjustments should be removed and replaced with either UAH or RSS."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title, \"\"Severed\"\" (it's in my library, in fact).  But, if you look closely at the definition of \"\"sever\"\", Short's body wasn't really severed, it was cut in two.  Definition of \"\"sever\"\" from Webster's: to put or keep apart  divide; especially  to remove (as a part) by or as if by cutting.  To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships.  Divide; especially  to remove (as a part)... doesn't fit what happened to Short's body, because her body wasn't divided into parts but actually bisected.  With all of this in mind, I think that if \"\"severed\"\" is insisted on and kept, the words, \"\"in two\"\" need to be added.

You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the cham albanians\r\n\r\n\"\"Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced\"\" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2006 Illyrians.org.\r\nDuring the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\r\n\r\nChams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\r\n\r\nThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\r\n\r\nThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\r\n\r\nDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

It hasn't worked with you, you're still unreasaonble, but I do it anyway for emphasis, and for the benefit of others. \r\n\r\n \"\"The term \"\"Arabic numerals\"\" is actually a misnomer\"\"\r\n This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to \u0967, \u0968, \u0969, \u096a, \u096b, \u096c, \u096d, \u096e, \u096f, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). \r\n\r\n \"\"... what are known in English as \"\"Arabic numerals\"\" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs.\"\", \"\"In the Arab World\u2014until modern times\u2014the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.\"\"\r\n What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.\r\n\r\n \"\"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.\"\"\r\n Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, \"\"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876\"\" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science \"\"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD\"\". According to Menninger (p. 400): \"\"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land \"\"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden.\"\" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression \"\"50 wreaths of flowers\"\" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity.\"\" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, \"\"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century.\"\" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.  \r\n\r\n \"\"However, it is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article.

The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making \u201cbubble cars\u201d under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.\r\n\r\nThese cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coup\u00e9, known colloquially but never popularly as \u201cthe egg\u201d\"\"\r\n\r\nExtract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle\r\n\r\nBut then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.\r\n\r\n\"\"The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, \u201cdas rollende Ei\u201d or \u201cthe rolling egg\u201d The Isetta\u2019s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.\r\n\r\nSteering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn\u2019t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.\"\"\r\n\r\nExtract from: What Were They Thinking?: Really Bad Ideas Throughout History by Bruce Felton\r\n  \""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

I was told that I should place my source as a footnote on the end of the sentance. I was also told that \"\"regressed\"\" would be a better word than \"\"digressed\"\". Other than that I was told to leave a note here on your talks page and on Talk:Foresters Falls, Ontario so that there will be no edit war. Since you haven't responded to me in two days I'll go ahead and add my sourced, factual, NPOV statement.

I removed the refimprove templates on both the Kent, Ohio and Theodore Roosevelt High School (Kent, Ohio) articles because they really aren't needed.  Both articles can still be improved in many ways, but they both are well-sourced.  Their placement was done in spite, not for any actual encylcopedic reason or concern over content.  It seems that when editors, particularly new editors, get in a disagreement with me, their solution is to edit the pages I edit the most.  Same thing happened with a newer editor who edited the Akron, Ohio article a little while back if you remember.  I feel the latest edits, particularly what was placed on your and my talk pages and in my user page could be considered Harassment.    \r\nOh, it's definitely harassment, and the anti-Mormon tone to it makes me sad even though I'm not LDS.

"There has been polling on this , and support among Canadians for assisted suicide exceeds 80 . Sadly , some folk choose to end their lives early , while they still can , rather than be stuck without it once they can no longer do it for themselves . So , ironically , the opponents are actually expediting some deaths . Research has also shown that lots of people , once they get approval , actually choose not to go through with it . But just knowing the option was available gave them peace of mind .",0

This is a great article . I suggest making friends with the people of the First Nations . I did years ago and was able to spend time living on a reserve in Southern Ontario .

"The men and women of our military are committed and as they have shown in the past are among the best not withstanding having been let down by the self aggrandisement of the Minister of Defence . What they do not have is the best equipment whether it is supposed to fly , drive , float or shoot ! They are seriously handicapped and the politics at play especially with fighter jets treats them with contempt . Now for all Ms Freeland 's well intentioned words a speech would have been better than reading documents in the House where is the show of strength , where is the back up , that can be counted on . We are small in many ways but have in the past punched above our weight . With the current ringmasters I fear we will be left singing in the wind , serenaded by platitudes . I doubt the latest primped foray by Mr Trudeau into the airwaves of the USA from the border at Niagara Falls is quite what Ms Freeland 's remit needed .",0

Golf tends to be played in gated parks denuded of humans . Great work Cathal and your editor .

"I never portrayed Islam as squeaky clean , and I never said that being weary is being hateful . I 'd appreciate it if you take what I say at face value and not load my statements with assumptions . I did say it 's bigoted , which is basically ignorance and intolerance of views you do not understand . My question to you is that if Islam is dangerous for these reasons then why is n't Christianity ? I can find bible versus where God himself orders the murdering of children . Do I assume that you serve a violent religion and I should be concerned about having you in my community ? The reasons you give me for why that is n't true apply to Islam as well . Your failure to understand that is what makes your views bigoted . You demand special pleading for your views , and then hold others to stronger scrutiny than you hold yourself . This is no justification , but you 'd be surprised how many young Muslim men list ignorance , racism , and bigotry like in this article as their reason for becoming radicalized .",1

Then there is just the straight news which ought to , as best as possible , just give you the facts of the story e.g .

"Exactly , typical New Dinosaur hypocrisy . Given NDP track record in financial corruption , they 'd ban open disclosure of donations , but allow it to trickle underground .

Dix , Horgan , they were all a part of it . They were discovered and charged . The NDP Premier resigned . Stupich the NDP 's henchman had over 6o criminal charges of theft , fraud and forgery . Later , a corruption inquiry found that the NDP had even used stolen money to pay off NDP members to give up their safe seats one of them for exPremier Dave Barrett to get reelected .

"Two problems with this theory Private sector employees are not legally allowed to set aside as much money for retirement as many public sector employees are . Public sector retirement contributions can be up to 25 of gross compensation , while there is a 18 cap on contributions to RRSPs in the private sector Public sector total compensation , for a large number of jobs , vastly exceeds that in the private sector . Looking just at wages might not show a huge gap , but when you add in the value of employer paid pension contributions the public sector workers are often compensated at a much higher level than comparable workers in the private sector . The only exceptions are near the very top of the income chain where people like lawyers and executives can often do better in the private sector . For entrylevel positions note the comment above about save early in life the gap is particularly large .",0

"Neither Damore 's nor Soh 's conclusions were based upon good science . Rather both chose which science fit their narrative and went from there .

Thus , any belief that Damore 's manifesto or Soh 's article are scientifically based is a crock . Both ignore many , many factors that could easily refute their views and explain the gender differences via socialized structures within our society . To ignore these factors is very , very bad science since socialized factors may dominate any gender specific tendencies .

Canada can compete with anyone in the world on a level playing field . . . it 's time the dairy industry was made to do so instead of luxuriating in excessive sales prices Canadians at present are caused to pay .

"1 . Catholics who are excluded from Communion because they are divorced and remarried are not excommunicated . They are in the same state as you and I would be after having committed a mortal sin and not repented and confessed it .

Our Lord 's parting words to the woman taken in adultery were , .... sin no more . That was Our Lord 's pastoral advice to that poor woman . Pastorality does not mean condoning sinfulness , it means in this situation leading someone out of habitual sinfulness until such time as they are able to avoid not only the sin but the occasions of that sin . In the case of remarried divorcés it means at least living as brother and sister . Anyone who genuinely desired to embrace the Catholic Faith would surely accept this . 2 . Easily done . 3 .

Since we lived next door , and the wall between our properties was low , we could still enjoy the concert but it was pretty clear who was being excluded . In this atmosphere , Catholics were forced to stay with their own group , unhappiness with the Church or no . In the 60s , young people largely abandoned these attitudes and Catholics were considered the same as everyone else . Catholics thus became more willing to evaluate the Church on its own merits , which , institutionally , were not very strong .",1

The problems with M103 are apparent , particularly where it seeks to condemn irrational human fear or belief as in any phobia or , paradoxically , could be applied to religion , which renders it logically ludicrous , but more importantly , and dangerously , where it broadly and unrestrictedly condemns all forms of behavior that its promoters consider to be unacceptable , and therefore veers into the realm of authoritarianism .

The alternative , if you control new units , is that landlords do n't build new units and defer maintenance on old units until they become uninhabitable , at which point they tear them down or abandon them . NYC has a lot of this . You ignore market forces at your peril . Most jurisdictions avoid rent controls because they obviously cause a rental unit shortage . Toronto is one of the few places that has rent controls , New York City is another . Both places have skyhigh rents and shortages of livable rental accommodation . Most other cities have reasonable rents and no shortage of accommodation . It 's just basic economics .",0

"China relationship is hypocritical A friend of mine who been living in China for 8 years recently sent me a letter slamming the election of Donald Trump by the US . I thought to myself , no such danger of the people , or electorate , making a similar choice in China . While we chide every university students perceived microaggression , China exhibits real aggression by seeking to impose it will on her neighbors . While we decry Israel building settlements , China gets a pass as it builds military islands in disputed waters . Somehow it seems China is just too big to fail or stand in front of but I 'm not sure dealing with them on their terms and becoming a de facto satellite is correct .",1

"Let us not forget that when Alaskans voted in statehood the statehood compact said the State would be paid 90 percent of the royalties from oil , gas , and coal development on federal land . This was supposed to give the state enough taxes to support a state with a very small population .

The lockup of federal land in Alaska by ANILCA pulled the rug out from the hope of ever supporting this state with resource development on federal land .",0

Yes , of course there are many thousands of companies that get some kind of hype before they fall flat . But this is n't some speculative penny stock , either . There is a lot of value in having daily active users in 9 figures , and it is n't a trivial question of what that value is . The more interesting analyses of Snap have focused on its high operational costs , unusual for what it is , and questions of whether this might indicate an inexperienced management team a red flag , to be sure .

At about 2,000 per person according to Expedia , plus the cost of their replacements while they are in Cuba , I 'm suggesting that the taxpayers of Eugene are paying for five or ten people 's vacations when there is 'insufficient money ' to properly educate the kids in 4J . At least according to the teachers ' unions . To even consider the possibility that Eugene is going to send our kids to school or our teachers to teach for 12 hours per day because that 's what they find successful in Cuba is absolutely ludicrous ! Eugene 4J can'twon'tis n't sure that they can send our kids to school for the minimum required by State law and policy . 4J weaseled out of meeting that standard just last week !",0

"The article raises some valid concerns . Congestion and road use charges which should be easily calculable and levied as each vehicle becomes a tracked node on the Internet could provide the economic pressure required to effectively promote the use of transit and ridesharing . The trillions of dollars of real estate value currently dedicated to roads represent a massive subsidy of those who commute by car , relative to those who live in the city and walk , and justify the levying of substantial charges for automotive commuters . In addition to the cost advantages of living in the city , the end of ICEpowered vehicles will also make cities more livable by reducing the toxicity of the air . I believe that marketbased solutions to the problems identified by Reguly are readily available .",0

But i digress . Yes , many precincts were understaffed . And there are some precincts that barely have voters , and there are mailonly precincts as well . I do n't know about you , but I issued a LOT of provisional ballots for people that were n't even registered to vote , who insisted that they be allowed to submit what will be a burned ballot .

"Congressman Young facilitated federal restrictions on how passenger fees could be spent in a measure related to port security back in 2002 , or thereabouts . The federal law provisions do not make the fees collected by a local government a dedicated fund contrary to the Alaska Constitution but they do limit the allocation of funds to projects or activities that promote the safety and efficiency of cruise vessel passengers . Obviously using the funds to construct a large passenger wharf is sanctioned by federal law . Using the funds for activities unrelated to safe and efficient movement of cruise passengers would violate the law . Whether using funds for a park that will be used , in part , by passengers is an open question , at this point . As this lawsuit is decided , it is worth noting that the fees in question are paid for by the passengers , not the cruise lines . Do the cruise lines even have standing to challenge the fees being collected from passengers and not the cruise lines !",0

Untreatable or 'idiopathic pain ' not only destroys the quality of a persons life but also an individuals ability to function , even at the most basic level . So now , because a bunch of stupid , idiots decide to use prescription painkillers to get high and escape reality , people with a legitimate need for pain relief are stigmatized as potential drug addicts and refused the medications they desperately need to survive . All this because of a paranoid medical profession , that ca n't figure out how to assess , monitor and maintain their patients for the intelligent and responsible use of pain relieving medications .

"Better democracy is about more representation in the corridors of power for ordinary citizens . And there 's a more specific everyday way of creating that happy circumstance . Clearly there are way too many lawyers in the inaccessible halls of Parliament , not nearly enough lawyers available to everyday Canadians at the grassroots level . The cost of hiring a lawyer prohibitively expensive for the majority , obtaining justice in a court of law is impossible for most Canadians . Millions victimized by personal injuries , human rights violations or crimes and Canadians unable to obtain their rights from government bureaucracies , can not obtain compensation in court . There is therefore no equal justice and no democracy for the majority . We need to demand access to a lawyer for all . The first responsibility of government is to protect all citizens . But without the ability to hire a lawyer for the many legal wrongs most Canadians suffer at some time , there is no democracy .",0

The entire world governed under parliamentry systems was in shock by the reckless and vindictive use of this procedure that was used by the Liberals and NDP when it was n't necessary and compromise and reason has always been the solution .

The allegation about the Russian interference was made by a top Clinton campaign official almost as soon as the email leaks began , presumably mainly to deflect attention from the emails themselves . So , this allegation was made and emphasized by the Clinton campaign during the election and was known to the voters well before the vote . The idea that this election , despite Clinton 's many advantages and all the support she received from most of the media and the big donors , was lost because the voters were made aware of some emails seems like a form of denial and a way for Clinton and her campaign officials to explain themselves in front of their donors and avoid some thorough selfassessment .",0

This peaceful village at the base of Reston Ridge and the Coos Bay Wagon Road must be devastated tonight as for Robert Adams , who can comprehend the horror he must have felt finding his family wiped out by his foster son ? And who can fathom the mind of a 16 year old boy who could do this killing ? And then calmly tell his foster father to call the police ... Coincidentally this area was once the scene of a true massacre just down the road by Lookingglass Creek . In October 1855 , at the beginning of the socalled Rogue Indian War a band of peaceful Umpqua Indians , mostly women , children and old people , had taken refuge on Arrington 's farm . One night a gang of local white guys , likely drunk , rode out from Roseburg and opened fire on the unarmed Natives , killing most of them . Thus the first Lookingglass Massacre .",0

Your second assertion makes no sense that I can see . This ruling creates no such legal precedent . As far as I know , the rules around consent and sexual assault were written by the Supreme Court of Canada . It does n't get any more precedential than that . No person , highly intoxicated or not , may be sexually assaulted . And whether or not you 're highly intoxicated , saying No means exactly that . A physical attempt to engage in sex after that refusal is an assault . But looking at it after the fact , if the complainant says he ca n't remember whether he gave consent or not , it will be very difficult to prove that a crime was committed . There is a simple remedy . Unless you 're in a very safe place , do n't drink to the point where you ca n't remember what you did or said .",0

One has to assume the Canadian health care system was designed this way to appease private corporations , and particularly the insurance industry . A classbased analysis would surely conclude that it 's mainly middleclass workers who benefit from the current system , but this is the same group of taxpayers that 's been asked over the past three decades to furnish an increasing portion of government revenues while getting few direct benefits in return .

Unsealed documents from back then make that fact unambiguously clear . The Democrat party had filled our government with communist spies at the highest level . McCarthy was right and had he allowed the left wing name calling and anti free speech , and antiConstitution left to silence him with threats of calling his speech a hate crime and a criminal act like they have done in Europe and are currently trying to do here then we would all be speaking Russian or Chinese right now . Speak truth to power and let no one put new limits on free speech it does n't matter who 's feelings get hurt",0

"This man is a lying sack of crap who was one of Bush 's mouthpieces in excusing the illegal war of choice against Iraq then and to this day . Bush did use lies to launch that disastrous war and this propagandist along with the entire rest of the Bush administration should have been put on trial for it . A couple of days ago GOP loyalist Michael Gerson penned a column actually suggesting that Condi mushroom clouds Rice should have been a candidate for POTUS as part of the rewriting of history going down by serious never Trumpers in the GOP . Being apologist for an administration that used war as a first choice rather than a last resort disqualifies this odious man from any serious consideration . Remember that there would have been no congressional vote on the AUMF if invading that nation that had nothing to do with 911 , no WMD and nor al Queda affiliation if it had not been so heavily pushed by the Bush administration . It was in fact their top priority at the very first cabinet meeting",1

Unless you are a top 1 wage earner , get almost all of your income from investments or own a corporation there is nothing of substance in this tax bill for you .

Another attempt to invoke Nazi Germany . There was a referendum and it was democratic . What on earth does that have to do with the Daily Mail ? A referendum is part but only one part of the democratic process . The extent to which the democratic process in its entirety was attacked by unelected tribunes of the people was one of the more alarming effects of the referendum campaign and its aftermath .

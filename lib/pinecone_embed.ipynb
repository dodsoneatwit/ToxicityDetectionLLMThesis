Posted 9122006 940 PM ET Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are . Well , you know , his company was vulnerable to The Innovator 's Dilemma , especially because he did n't have a World Is Flat strategy , although he could 've seen it coming if he 'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach . This is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent . Anyway , the concept of the wisdom of crowds the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki is particularly hot among tech companies right now . Yet in the past week , the concept has run into a couple of potholes . - Label: 0\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Text: One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg.com the other , the U.K. government 's case of the hijacked wiki . Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise , and what conditions have to exist to make them wise . Why is it that some crowds seem smart , while others turn into ugly mobs ? At its most basic level , the wisdom of crowds let 's call it WOC , so I do n't have to type as much means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts . The WOC has been around forever it 's what democratic elections try to tap into . But the Net takes it to a whole new level . The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and costeffective way , Surowiecki tells me . So if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees , the employees will make better decisions than the CEO . IBM , Google and others have tried this . Wikipedia , written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors , should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists . News sites such as Digg , which lets users vote stories to the front page , should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors . Except it does n't always work that way . Pointing specifically at Wikipedia , Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a basic fallacy that a wisdomofcrowds approach could ever work , even theoretically . Which might be extreme . But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings . Take Digg . Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise If you like a news item or blog post , you can digg it by voting for it . Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page . But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items . Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so savvy members . So last week , Rose changed the formula . Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking . Digg 's regulars revolted , causing a big Web stink . But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better . The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments , Surowiecki says . Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input . So WOC needs the right structure to work , something the U.K. 's Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA found out the hard way . DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts , so it posted one on the Net as a wiki . The idea of a wiki such as Wikipedia is that anyone can log on and add or change something . In the case of DEFRA 's wiki , the public mutilated it . In one of the more printable alterations , someone changed Who are the parties to the environmental contract to Where is the party for the environmental contract ? Can I come ? - Label: 0\"),\n",

Part of the problem is ... it does n't take a lot of people to cause such disruptions . Wikis , as it turns out , are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress . Depending on who last wrote something , at any one time the wiki might be good , or bad . Despite hiccups , though , there 's still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC . Google , in its own way , is a WOC device . It analyzes links that millions of people put on websites to come up with the most relevant search results .

The great big idea is that this site is developed by the people of the world , and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias , which have been around for hundreds of years , do not or can not include . To my mind , and all the other sane , normal people of the world , this is all ridiculous . Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest . It is a shortcut to thinking . And clearly there is very little thinking here .

Through these intimidations , using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced minority bad loans at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are in today in February 2009 . The government initiated bailouts really government theft and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in stimulus packages as an excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem . Most of this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will never rise above .

Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote Where Pocket billiards links to Pool cue sports . In a similar way the section Cue sportsList of cue sports says that English billiards another hybrid of Carom billiards games , but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocketless Carom games , and if Snooker see below popularly regarded as its own sport , not a pool variant is its own sport so is English billiards .

If Pocket billiards turns out not to have one meaning , and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sportsList of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections , or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports . - Label: 0'),\n",

They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms books , heridity , stories , fables etc . For e.g . Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago . Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another . the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma . Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes rebirth again . Kamma may recoil on the doer if i kill , i may get killed through revenge or it may have an impact on others if i take a bribe , my children will have to suffer social stigma or it can have effect on the future generations if i harm the environment mindlessly , future generations will not get clean waterair . It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer . Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible .

Specifically about NPOV as it manifests in the Dianetics article . Untill a subject is introduced it can not be argued . The latest and greatest One more try intertwines two points of view , I 'll grant that . But do n't you see all the discussion on the page from everyone who has done some Dianetics saying , This article makes no sense , it is n't something that can be followed even by a person knowledgeable in Dianetics Do n't you see that happening ?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Text: ! Well , that is all right , as far as it goes . But it does not make clear what Dianetics is , do you see the problem ? I believe the reason why is simply that Dianetics is never allowed to be introduced because you have to make the article have controversy in every damn line of it ! No , Terryeo , I do n't think controversy and criticism belong in every line , and I think if you look closely at what I 've written , you 'll see that is n't the case . I know you wish it were otherwise , but the social consensus about Dianetics is at odds with the way Hubbard and Scientologists view it . Readers should be informed of this from the outsetit is the social context in which Dianetics exists . That does n't mean that Hubbard 's ideas ca n't be fairly represented , and I think they should be . I did look closely at what you wrote , the very first line of it had a lie in it , an unverifiable statement . I am very glad you used the word context because that is exactly my point . If you will look at this wiki link about introductions it tells you where context should appear in an introduction and it is an important thing to know . However , it is not to appear in the first line of an introduction . I am simply following wiki policy here and please get off the I know you think it should be otherwise because i am going to continue to insist on wiki policy being followed . Here is the link which tells when in an introduction , context should be stated WikipediaIntroductions First the term is introduced . In the case of Dianetics the introduction of the term should probably include its origins because it is a word created from Greek roots unfamilar to many people . Then , after the term itself is introduced the topic needs be introduced . - Label: 0\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Text: This is the policy , read it right there . Then , after the topic is introduced so readers can know what is being talked about then , at that point context . It is not that you are doing things wrong , but slightly out of sequence for a reader to be able to understand , okay ? Happy New Year ! Terryeo , I 'd suggest that this sort of discussion take place on the article 's talk page in the future , since it is likley to be seen as relevant by other editors . As to the policy about introductions , I find it hard to believe you mean this seriously . The guideline says that the introduction defines the term and topic and context it says nothing about the order in which those things are presented . And introducing a term rarely involves spelling out the etymology of the term . Again , it does n't all need to happen in the short intro . Look at line 2 of that intro guideline . BTfromLA , what part of term , topic , context is unclear to you ? Term , this means the word itself . Topic , this means the topic itself . The Wiki Policy makes this clear , it spells it out A , B , C. What is your argument ? It does not say , Context and controversy first ! and then , when people understand the whole subject is nothing but a controversy and should be left alone and never understood , then introduces the definition of the term . No , it does not say , Stuff these things in the intro any way you want to . It says , Term . Topic . Context . A and then B and then C. okay ? It says everything about the order of presentation . First is says Term . How simple can it be , you got to tell your student the meaning of the word you use . Then it says topic . How simple can it be , you have to tell the student what you are going to be talking about . Then , after that , after people know what the topic is , then , then is the time for context . okay ?

If you have any doubts , then check the discussion page for that article . It was n't long ago that all references to Keith Wigdor were removed from this surrealism article . This removal occured because of Wigdor 's total unimportance to the surrealist movement , for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is , at best , an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist , and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist . Needless to say , many of the englishspeaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him . Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist . It is also interesting to note , if you check the discussion archives of this surrealism article , that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist , in this very article . Also , if you look at some of the recent , belligerent , trollish , thikeish posts of these 2 users , it should n't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor . For the 2 noname users mentioned here , who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor , it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run .

However , the actual phrase from the book 'From the Gracchi to Nero ' is emerged , according to tradition , a monster of lust and diabolical cruelty . Scullard does not support this view himself ! He is merely remarking that Roman historians tended to take this view , a view that most modern historians have moderated to a great extent . I suggest that the quote is removed , or changed to a more accurate modern reflection of the view with another quote from Scullard , The balance of his mind was to some degree upset , which is quite different from the description of a monster .\n",

      "Text: Why wikipedia 's mod system does not work httpwww.usatoday.comtechcolumnistkevinmaney20060912wisdomofcrowds_x.htm Techies hot on concept of 'wisdom of crowds , ' but it has some pitfalls ... Posted 9122006 940 PM ET Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are . Well , you know , his company was vulnerable to The Innovator 's Dilemma , especially because he did n't have a World Is Flat strategy , although he could 've seen it coming if he 'd tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach . This is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent . Anyway , the concept of the wisdom of crowds the title of a popular 2004 book by James Surowiecki is particularly hot among tech companies right now . Yet in the past week , the concept has run into a couple of potholes . One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg.com the other , the U.K. government 's case of the hijacked wiki . Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise , and what conditions have to exist to make them wise . Why is it that some crowds seem smart , while others turn into ugly mobs ? At its most basic level , the wisdom of crowds let 's call it WOC , so I do n't have to type as much means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts . The WOC has been around forever it 's what democratic elections try to tap into . But the Net takes it to a whole new level . The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and costeffective way , Surowiecki tells me . So if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees , the employees will make better decisions than the CEO . IBM , Google and others have tried this . Wikipedia , written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors , should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists . News sites such as Digg , which lets users vote stories to the front page , should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors . Except it does n't always work that way . Pointing specifically at Wikipedia , Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a basic fallacy that a wisdomofcrowds approach could ever work , even theoretically . Which might be extreme . But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings . Take Digg . Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise If you like a news item or blog post , you can digg it by voting for it . Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page . But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items . Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1,000 or so savvy members . So last week , Rose changed the formula . Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking . Digg 's regulars revolted , causing a big Web stink . But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better . The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments , Surowiecki says . Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input . So WOC needs the right structure to work , something the U.K. 's Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA found out the hard way . DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts , so it posted one on the Net as a wiki . The idea of a wiki such as Wikipedia is that anyone can log on and add or change something . In the case of DEFRA 's wiki , the public mutilated it . In one of the more printable alterations , someone changed Who are the parties to the environmental contract to Where is the party for the environmental contract ? Can I come ? Will there be cake ? Hooray ! These sorts of issues have permeated the Net , Weinstein says . Part of the problem is ... it does n't take a lot of people to cause such disruptions . Wikis , as it turns out , are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress . Depending on who last wrote something , at any one time the wiki might be good , or bad . Despite hiccups , though , there 's still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC . Google , in its own way , is a WOC device . It analyzes links that millions of people put on websites to come up with the most relevant search results . The reputation system on eBay uses WOC to selfpolice its users . One of the more intriguing WOC site\n",

      "Text: Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human Shocking news break . It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me ! A real person .... not a 'sock puppeteer . ' There are no socks and no puppets . Just a real person who thought that a business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia . Someone who actually understands the business he is in , unlike the editors , who have no experience in the field whatsoever . It turns out or so we can surmise , that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company . Oh no ! This ca n't be ! It 's a business ... not an encyclopedic fact ! But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world . otherwise , why does it exist ? Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient . Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising . ' Yet other advertising companies , like Modernista , BBDO , DDB , Ogilvy , etc . are all here ... blatant advertising . So , how big does a company have to be to be listed on Wiki ? The answer there is no answer . It 's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor experience in business , who call themselves Carbuncle , Smeff , Dongfart , and the rest . This is surely detrimental to the Wiki . Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this ? The very idea of limiting what is shown here censoring pure facts arbitrarily is against the very idea of a global Wiki . The great big idea is that this site is developed by the people of the world , and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias , which have been around for hundreds of years , do not or can not include . To my mind , and all the other sane , normal people of the world , this is all ridiculous . Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest . It is a shortcut to thinking . And clearly there is very little thinking here . I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they can not find ISM on Wikipedia , and many from people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research . Everyone was rebuffed . What kind of person would do this what kind of person would sit in their little room , hiding information from others , and trying to keep reality away at any cost ? Sock Puppets ? Suspicious users ? Legal threats ? What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who originally wrote the article and who always ALWAYS asked for editor input and support ? Go on look at the history . You will see that editor input was always taken at first , despite the fact that all editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject . When asked to explain themselves , no one had the nous to do so . Delicious Carbuncle , BlueBoy , Todd1 , Fisher Queen , etc . All refused to answer for their actions . Cowards and buffoons who have no sense , courage , nor intelligence . Anyone who makes an attack on another person , as these 'editors ' have , and runs away without facing the person they have attacked , is not deserving of their powers . I am now convinced that Wikipedia , despite it 's noble origins , is just a place for fools to feel power in a world where they are unable to have any in reality . Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site . You have no argument and have no intelligence if you think you do , face me like a real human talk , discuss , and the rest . Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid , sarcastic comment and run away ... hiding ... and never respond to your comments . Cheers , Kevin Nicholas Known as kmnicholas or ismboston and , yes , I live in England of you bothered to ask and my mobile phone number is 07791 410 501 so stop making out that I 'm hiding or tricking anyone .

I am not too concerned with the current notable ... phrase but second Leifern 's tagging , for example because of a concern I brought up about a week ago that the ocntrovertial nature of homeopathy should not be alluded to twice in the introduction becase it diverts the issue from exegesis to premature evaluation I suggested a comprehensive sentence that highlighted rather than obscured the controvertiallity issue but without this diversion . There are many little things in the article that were written from a lay perspective of those who have read a bit about homeopathy and think that they know a lot , and unless those are repaired there is no reason to remove the tag . Besides , it is reasonable to have this tag on indefinitely due to the wide disagreement on the topic . This is not a bad thing as one thing can be stated with certainty that the issue of homeopathy is not as simple as it looks , so each reader will need both critical faculties and research time to make sense of it . 1 July 2005 1428 UTC\n",

      "Text: Being intimidated at the polling place got my clear attention what the truth was , here is the article I would write , go ahead , shoot it full of holes . Enlighten me ! HOW OBAMA AND ACORN STOLE THE ELECTION OF 2008 Overview Presently , ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama who was one of its principles . It 's a matter we take very seriously , FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton told the Associated Press . It is against the law to register someone to vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote , or to put someone on there falsely . Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of 37 million who 's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election through massive voter fraud . However , they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically left wing with actual communist memberships . Most of their funding comes from U.S. government grants . Further , to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD public housing and choice voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing thereto . This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing civil rights laws . Through these intimidations , using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced minority bad loans at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are in today in February 2009 . The government initiated bailouts really government theft and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in stimulus packages as an excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem . Most of this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will never rise above . Although President George BushR played his share in ridiculous deregulation , ACORN with backing from Barney FrankD the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans . The case details 95 of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders . Nonetheles , Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm , analogues to how the influx of illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections , particularly the election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness , legality and constitutionality thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by primetime television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications . Such is the case because in Maricopa County , much like other counties in the United States population not citizenship determines voting districts . And there 's clear , mounting evidence that both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using people that ca n't vote as filler people to fill up the extra people needed to make up a given district along with the people that favor their political party . Such is particularly the case because the census figures do n't distinguish the difference between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process . v8oTQoZifckUfeaturerelated Polls in Mexico indicate that the majority favored Obama and the election results showed clearly that such minority voters such as Hispanic and African American voters overwhelmingly voted for him and clearly won the election for Obama . See Wikipedia United States presidential election of 2008 Consider the 2006 report by Jonathan Bechtle , Voter Turnout or Voter Fraud ? which includes a discussion of the nexus between Project Vote and ACORN , a nexus where Obama himself\n",

      "Text: Hi , I dont really care much for the SerbAlbanian disputes but I thought it was common knowledge that Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia at least theoretically . The way it is written it makes it sound that Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia . I am pretty sure this is not the case otherwise its position under international law would be similar to that of Montenegro and independence would be much less of a problem than it is at this point . The article should be unprotected and reference to Serbia should be included . I dont think Albanian wikipedians should try to stop this from happening . The problem and paradox of Kosovo still being part of Serbia is not going to go away by negating it on wikipedia . If I were Kosovar Albanian i would be trying to make this be known so as to find a solution for the future of my territory .

      "Text: Pocket billards The term pocket billiards is used inconsistently in the article . Does it mean Pool or pocket billiards , generally played on a table with six pockets ... where pocket billiards links to pool cue sports or is it a generic name for all billiard type games played on a table with pockets as in its is used in the section Cue sportsMajor games carom and pocket . Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote Where Pocket billiards links to Pool cue sports . In a similar way the section Cue sportsList of cue sports says that English billiards another hybrid of Carom billiards games , but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocketless Carom games , and if Snooker see below popularly regarded as its own sport , not a pool variant is its own sport so is English billiards . If it can not be decided what Pocket billiards means in American English and Commonwealth English then we should avoid using the term , or define what we mean by it before it is used in the article . Also I do not think that sources over 30 years old , should be used to define a term like Pocket billiards as language changes and usage of such phrases does as well . Eg if the American professional organisations have been pressing for it to mean pool type games , and snooker professional organisations tend not to use the term , then it is probably better to define it that American way and stick with that American usage in an article such as this . If Pocket billiards turns out not to have one meaning , and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sportsList of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections , or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports .\n",

In my opinion , the deeds kammaand its effect of an individual , being completely irreversible , are stored in the collective memories of others . They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms books , heridity , stories , fables etc . For e.g . Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago . Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another . the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma . Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes rebirth again . Kamma may recoil on the doer if i kill , i may get killed through revenge or it may have an impact on others if i take a bribe , my children will have to suffer social stigma or it can have effect on the future generations if i harm the environment mindlessly , future generations will not get clean waterair . It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer . Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible . Thus its imperative to THINK before acting .

First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template including genre , art direction , casting , second unit director , costume design for example . Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilmsWesterns to conentrate on improving western film articles I know a number of members who would be interested . You 'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images these include TemplateFilmrationale for screenshots and posters and TemplateFilmbiorationale for all deceased film people . I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO ! much easier . It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them . For normal bios use TemplateBiorationale I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles , For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images . Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain ? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1 . I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out . Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960present is really needed . Hope you are well and await your response Expecting you Contribs\n",

The numerical values of the four components of Ad are exactly the same as those which appear three times each among the components of Aa b c along with three each which are their negatives and forty zeros . So this is merely selecting a subset of components which represent the independent information in the original A . If someone naively attempted to use Maxwell 's equations in a curvilinear coordinate system or in the presence of significant amounts of gravity , then he would find that they still work in that context except for the constitutive equations which relate D to E and H to B . How can this be explained in your ideology ? It only makes sense when one realizes that some of the quantities are tensor densities . So please see that I am not adding tensor densities to make life harder . Rather I am finding that they already exist and permitting their use to avoid the extra and unnecessary work of converting everything to ordinary tensors . Why multiply by the metric when you do not have to ? Why use the LeviCivita connection when partial derivatives will suffice ?\n",

The names of the children of very well known celebrities are often included , for example Angelina Jolie or Gwyneth Paltrow because the kids names are already mentioned in so many news stories about them .

With Terreyo 's permision , I have pasted the discussion here , as I think it is relevant to the editing of the page , and may be of interest to other editors . Specifically about NPOV as it manifests in the Dianetics article . Untill a subject is introduced it can not be argued . The latest and greatest One more try intertwines two points of view , I 'll grant that . But do n't you see all the discussion on the page from everyone who has done some Dianetics saying , This article makes no sense , it is n't something that can be followed even by a person knowledgeable in Dianetics Do n't you see that happening ? The problem is real , real simple . You seem to be creating an article that says , Dianetics is a controversial subject ! ! ! Well , that is all right , as far as it goes . But it does not make clear what Dianetics is , do you see the problem ? I believe the reason why is simply that Dianetics is never allowed to be introduced because you have to make the article have controversy in every damn line of it ! No , Terryeo , I do n't think controversy and criticism belong in every line , and I think if you look closely at what I 've written , you 'll see that is n't the case . I know you wish it were otherwise , but the social consensus about Dianetics is at odds with the way Hubbard and Scientologists view it . Readers should be informed of this from the outsetit is the social context in which Dianetics exists . That does n't mean that Hubbard 's ideas ca n't be fairly represented , and I think they should be . I did look closely at what you wrote , the very first line of it had a lie in it , an unverifiable statement . I am very glad you used the word context because that is exactly my point . If you will look at this wiki link about introductions it tells you where context should appear in an introduction and it is an important thing to know . However , it is not to appear in the first line of an introduction . I am simply following wiki policy here and please get off the I know you think it should be otherwise because i am going to continue to insist on wiki policy being followed . Here is the link which tells when in an introduction , context should be stated WikipediaIntroductions First the term is introduced . In the case of Dianetics the introduction of the term should probably include its origins because it is a word created from Greek roots unfamilar to many people . Then , after the term itself is introduced the topic needs be introduced . This is the policy , read it right there . Then , after the topic is introduced so readers can know what is being talked about then , at that point context . It is not that you are doing things wrong , but slightly out of sequence for a reader to be able to understand , okay ? Happy New Year ! Terryeo , I 'd suggest that this sort of discussion take place on the article 's talk page in the future , since it is likley to be seen as relevant by other editors . As to the policy about introductions , I find it hard to believe you mean this seriously . The guideline says that the introduction defines the term and topic and context it says nothing about the order in which those things are presented . And introducing a term rarely involves spelling out the etymology of the term . Again , it does n't all need to happen in the short intro . Look at line 2 of that intro guideline . BTfromLA , what part of term , topic , context is unclear to you ? Term , this means the word itself . Topic , this means the topic itself . The Wiki Policy makes this clear , it spells it out A , B , C. What is your argument ? It does not say , Context and controversy first ! and then , when people understand the whole subject is nothing but a controversy and should be left alone and never understood , then introduces the definition of the term . No , it does not say , Stuff these things in the intro any way you want to . It says , Term . Topic . Context . A and then B and then C. okay ? It says everything about the order of presentation . First is says Term . How simple can it be , you got to tell your student the meaning of the word you use . Then it says topic . How simple can it be , you have to tell the student what you are going to be talking about . Then , after that , after people know what the topic is , then , then is the time for context . okay ? You read any good ariticle on Wiki and you will find this procedure followed . This IS wiki policy . This IS the source of the ar\n",

      "Text: Racism , Noble savage , Orientalism and Araby No flaming intended , I just want balance to come to this subject . Explain to the world , how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal , is in any way , shape , or form , NPOV . You know , Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject e.g . Oliver Stone 's Alexander film . They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras . To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant , just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo . Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew . Whenever I watched Hercules The Legendary Journeys and Xena Warrior Princess , homosexuality did not come to mind . Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena get nasty with their traveling companions , but that 's beside the point . You ca n't always have it to your fantasy or ideal , simply by calling other people narrow . So far , you 've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals . Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people , founders of Europe , you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West . Nobody said they were all straight either , which is something you have to admit . Homosexual revisionism is not fact .\n",

      "Text: restored text that was deleted NEWBERRY , YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF USER 24 . HERE IS THE TEXT THAT USER 24 DELETED Ahhhh , I see that Wigdor , er , I mean , User24.168.66.27 , is trying to worm his way back into this surrealism article again . Stirling , you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article . Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks he 's the next Salvador Dali . Keith , er , I mean , User24.168.66.27 , I have my messages saved as text in a separate file , so if you delete my posts , then I will simply reinsert them . You ca n't bury the truth . 1651 , 13 Jan 2005 UTC User24.168.66.27 , Please do n't delete my posts . That is very rude . The following was deleted by user24.168.66.27 this morning . Why would he delete this post , I wonder If anyone is curious , in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism , it should be noticed that both user63.169.104.2 and user24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward . If you have any doubts , then check the discussion page for that article . It was n't long ago that all references to Keith Wigdor were removed from this surrealism article . This removal occured because of Wigdor 's total unimportance to the surrealist movement , for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is , at best , an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist , and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist . Needless to say , many of the englishspeaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him . Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist . It is also interesting to note , if you check the discussion archives of this surrealism article , that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist , in this very article . Also , if you look at some of the recent , belligerent , trollish , thikeish posts of these 2 users , it should n't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor . For the 2 noname users mentioned here , who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor , it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run . Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution , for they are one and the same , and also happen to be Keith Wigdor , who is playing a sockpuppet game . 2210 , 11 Jan 2005 UTC\n",

However , the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint . Also , there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another . That 's when a secondary source comes in . A secondary source 's author is one step removed from the event reducing the chance of bias , and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion , evaluation , andor conclusion . Furthermore , secondary sources are more likely to be published the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here . It helps us avoid original research . One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions , whether intentionally or not , which would be considered original research .

Wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs . The problem with , say , The Fox Nation , and The Huffington Post , in other words , is not that they lean right or left , respectively , but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order . For whatever reason , there is a lot more editor interest in adding often without context , say , what O'Donnell said about mice with human brains on TV than there is interest in adding what a more boring politician like Mitch Daniels said to The Economist . And there is undoubtedly more reader interest in O'Donnell than in Daniels as well . But our obligation here is to be encyclopedic . The Encyclopedia Britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one . Beyond this , one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even Fox News or HuffPo would have if they were to have a single story on O'Donnell , which is what we are constructing here . All this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial , widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them .\n",

I ca n't get into the specific detailsthat 's an entirely different topic , but I can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now . Cambridge Shopping Centers has placed it up for sale time and time again . Nobody wants it , and I do n't blame them . If Sears ever decides to pull out of there , they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it , because the land is worth more than the mall itself . Everything is going Northside anyway . Downtown Chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the 90 's , and it never fully recovered . And the Capitol Theatre ? Give me a break . They might as well give up on that too . It 's been what ? Over ten years now , and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing , we stil are n't any closer to it being finished , or having a final completion date . As far as Chatham as a city goes , I have never seen so many unsavoury , shady people in my life . Not everyone is like that , I agree , but yes it would seem as though Chatham does qualify as the welfare capitol on Ontario . Drugs , unwed mothers , crackheads , dropouts , second and third generation welfare families , a plethora of health problems , and well you get the pitcure . Is it any wonder why the younger crowd is leaving in droves ? I ca n't say that I blame them . The grass IS greener on the other side . Chatham 's prime was over a long time ago . It 's London and points East that you want to be ...\n",

Please review WPV to learn about appropriate , reliable sources for the information you keep adding , and also visit WPLIBEL and WPBLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people . Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous , and against Wikipedia policy . You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits . WPNPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia 's neutral point of view policy . The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a crush on each other were done in a joking manner , and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that 's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them , and if I said or insinuated that she were , that would be libel . These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other , and frankly , good public relations by supporting their onscreen chemistry and by extension , that of the fictional characters they play . Many other cast members have complimented their costars , including PD and EP , but no reliable source has , to my knowledge , ever published information that these two or any other cast members were anything other than costars who happen to be friends .

The whole section is very subjective , depending entirely on your point of view , and could be applied to plenty of films from that era . Further , none of the information there was cited . I am posting the section here in its entirety for reference . Language and Mindset of a Popular 1950s Musical Some parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now , though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956 Crosbys character sings a love song to an elevenyearold girl his exwifes younger sister who still has quite a crush on him the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughter 's body while upbraiding her for having no compassion , as most characters in the movie have already or soon will and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex separated from the moviegoing masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of , or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class . When Tracy Lord played by Kelly awakens hungover on her wedding day , she doesnt at first remember anything about her previous nights drunken carousing , but comes to believe she made love with Mike the reporter played by Sinatra and discusses it at length with her exhusband Dexter played by Crosby . At the time , of course , making love was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense . Being a romantic comedy , High Society plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel . There are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie , as Kittridge , the upandcoming coal magnate and fiance to the current mine owners daughter , is described as having worked his way up from being a miner , and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class , as is Sinatra 's journalist character .\n",

      "Text: You 've made three mistakes Is the version I 'd reverted to unstable ? On the contrary the version that you were attempting to revert to is unstable , because the chapter you 'd removed , was added three years ago on 5 May 2008 , and lasted until 14 March 2011 , i.e . until the day before yestreday , whereas the version you were attempting to revert to lasted for less than 40 hours only that were uncontinuous and broken , so which version is more stable ? Returning the chapter you 'd removed is not against the consensus at all . The chapter is supported by UserMOBDeadMeat , and is also supported by UserChrishatch1973 , and is also supported by UserEliko whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by UserBasket of Puppies only . Really , it was also supported in the past by UserDragonflySixtyseven , however their reason for the removal was refuted on their talk page and on the article talk page as well , and they did n't respond to the refutation . According to the law Silence gives consent , the very fact that UserDragonflySixtyseven did n't respond to the refutation shows that UserDragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page and on the article talk page as well for returning the chapter . To sum up , three editors UserMOBDeadMeat , UserChrishatch1973 and UserEliko support the chapter , and one single user UserBasket of Puppies rejects it , so which option is more consensual ? Returning the chapter , or removing it ? The chapter you removed is relevant , as I 'd explained on the article talk page before you removed the chapter . If you think the chapter is irrelevant despite my explanation on the article talk page why it 's relevant , then please discuss that on the article talk page . Note that when you responded to me on my talk page each one of us had made one revert only during 2011 , so considering that the single revert I 've made during 2011 was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP3RR and editwarring if I continue to revert , also your single revert you 've made during 2011 should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP3RR and editwarring if you continue to revert . If you continue to both remove a consensual chapter and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus , then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy , that requires to discuss everything on the article talk page before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus . Anyways due to your claim about irrelevance , I will add to the stable consensual chapter some clarifications , to make sure that every reader including UserBasket of Puppies understands its relevance .\n",

      "Text: Unprotected I 'm going to edit based on my comments in TalkNew_antiSemitismSourcing_claims_for_.22Countryspecific_incidents so could we discuss them now ? All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new antiSemitism i.e . coming from the left , related to radical antiZionism etc . talk They may well be , but they are not sourced that way . I do n't think we can expect the words new antiSemitism to appear in every single report we reference . We 've defined it , and we 've linked to many sources who are defining it . The definition is It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left . It is characterized by the demonization of the world 's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion . Israel 's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . The Jewish people 's right of selfdetermination is denied . Double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state . Symbols and images associated with classic antiSemitism are used for example , blood libels are resurrected , the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . Arab and Islamic antiSemitism are excused and ignored . Strawman attacks are made , whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is antiSemitism , and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the new antiSemitism . All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in Europe . It is found in conjunction with antiAmericanism because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government , antiZionism , and the antiglobalization movement . All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of antiSemitism or attacks on Jews . talk My worry is that Livingstone has not been at least in the sources provided accused of antisemitism , and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of antisemitism against his supporters . Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of antisemitism not reporting others allegations , which is OR and unwise in the case of Galloway . The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new antisemitism so I 'd just want to tidy that up . Livingstone has very definitely been accused of antiSemitism got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it , as has Galloway , and without question his supporters . The section talks about it in relation to that election . By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements . talk Slim , whose definition is this ? All the sources put together . The above are the issues they agree on . It was posted weeks ago . talk I think you mean all the sources from one side of the argument put together . It 's been a while since we discussed this , so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative ? Sorry , you 'll have to look in the archives they 're either there or in the article . By all the sources , I mean all the sources who study new antiSemitism . The above are the elements they appear to agree on . talk I 'm asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative . Please respond . UserC\n",

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up , then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a Other topics about Jesus towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of . I propose that we condense these topics 1 . Chronology which is under life and teachings , and we could include a reference to this article 's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section 2 . Background 3 . Names and titles 4 . Ethnicity and physical characteristics 5 . Artistic and dramatic portrayals And then , since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom , but is now gone , we can get rid of it . Also , since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the subtopic in more detail , we can get rid of many of the other sources . This should substantially reduce these sections 1 . Notes 2 . Sources and further reading 3 . See also 4 . External links After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter . Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice , and maybe Jesus can become a featured article . What do you all think ?\n",
